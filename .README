# the video game 

This uses the latest version of Godot (Godot 4.3)

## Prerequesites 

Due to the way the FMod plugin works, the addons folder is automatically ignored. 

You'll need to install the fmod plugin found here (https://github.com/utopia-rise/fmod-gdextension). 
Specifically the latest version as of writing (4.3.0-4.2.2).

- Create a folder called "addons" in the root of the Godot project
- drag the contents of the release into the "addons" folder
- if Godot is open, it will prompt you to restart the editor; you should do this.
